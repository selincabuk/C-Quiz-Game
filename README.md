# C-Quiz-Game
A quiz game console application consisting of Turkish questions coded in C language. The app has the option to display the highest score for each difficulty level by keeping the user's score on file, along with a variety of main menu options. Thanks to my classmates Mehmet Ali Tonga and Gökçe Çoban, with whom I developed this program for the BM101 Computer Programming I course.
